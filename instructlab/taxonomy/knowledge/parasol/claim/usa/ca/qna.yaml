      Your vehicle's headlights help you see what is in front of you. They also make it easier for other drivers to see your vehicle. Dim your high-beam headlights to low beams within 500 feet of a vehicle coming toward you or within 300 feet of a vehicle you are following. It is illegal to drive using only parking lights. Use your headlights:
      · When it is too dark to see from 1,000 feet away.
      · Until 30 minutes before sunrise.
      Beginning 30 minutes after sunset.
      In adverse weather. If you need to use your windshield wipers due to fog, rain, or snow, you must turn on your low-beam headlights.
      · On mountain roads and tunnels (even on sunny days).
      · When conditions (such as clouds, dust, smoke, or fog) prevent you from seeing other vehicles.
      When a road sign states that headlights must be on.
      · To help other drivers see your vehicle, especially when the sun is low on the horizon.

  - context: |
      Bicycle lanes are for bicyclists only and run alongside vehicle traffic. They are typically marked by a single solid white line and signs. They are sometimes painted bright green to make them easier to see.
      It is illegal to drive in a bicycle lane unless you are:
      · Parking (where permitted).
      · Turning (within 200 feet of an intersection).
      Entering or leaving the road.
      There are multiple types of bike lanes and markings:
      · Bike lane: Established along streets adjacent to vehicle traffic. Typically marked by a single solid white line that turns into a dash-line near an intersection.
      · Buffered bike lane: Uses chevrons or diagonal markings to provide greater separation from traffic and on-street parking.
      · Bike route: Uses bike route signs and shared road markings to designate a preferred route for bicyclists on streets shared with vehicle traffic.
      · Bicycle boulevard: Prioritizes bicycle travel on streets shared with vehicle traffic.
      · Separated bikeway: Is physically separated from motor vehicle traffic and for exclusive use of bicyclists. They are also known as a cycle track or protected bike lanes. The separation may include flexible posts, grade separation, inflexible barriers, or on-street parking. SHARE THE ROAD SHARROWS
      · Shared roadway bicycle markings Alert drivers that bicyclists can occupy the lane and help bicyclists maintain a safe lane position in traffic. :
      NOTE: Check your blind spots before entering a bike lane. If you drive a motorized bicycle, use caution to avoid other bicyclists. Travel at a reasonable speed and do not endanger the safety of other bicyclists.
