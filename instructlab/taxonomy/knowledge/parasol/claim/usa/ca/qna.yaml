      Your vehicle's headlights help you see what is in front of you. They also make it easier for other drivers to see your vehicle. Dim your high-beam headlights to low beams within 500 feet of a vehicle coming toward you or within 300 feet of a vehicle you are following. It is illegal to drive using only parking lights. Use your headlights:
      · When it is too dark to see from 1,000 feet away.
      · Until 30 minutes before sunrise.
      Beginning 30 minutes after sunset.
      In adverse weather. If you need to use your windshield wipers due to fog, rain, or snow, you must turn on your low-beam headlights.
      · On mountain roads and tunnels (even on sunny days).
      · When conditions (such as clouds, dust, smoke, or fog) prevent you from seeing other vehicles.
      When a road sign states that headlights must be on.
      · To help other drivers see your vehicle, especially when the sun is low on the horizon.
